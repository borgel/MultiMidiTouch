This is effectively an emulator for the Jazzmutant Lemur (http://www.jazzmutant.com/lemur_overview.php), written in Processing
and utilizing TUIO for data communication. It is designed to allow the user to use the Lemur JazzEditor (which creates layout
files) to design an interface, and then display/interact with it using a custom multi touch table. So its like a Lemur, but
one that dosen't cost thousands of dollars, or is bigger, or is installed somewhere, etc. 

Last this was developed, it supported almost all the objects the JazzEditor did, but not all. The .jzml files the editor
produces are just XML, so all that is left is designing the Java to draw the remaining object types.
